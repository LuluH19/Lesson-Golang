Docs: Variables are used to store values of specific data types in memory for later use are out of scope!

The following concepts were covered in this lesson:

- Go is a **pass-by-value** language.  
- An **address** is where a value is stored.  
- To find an address of a variable, use the `&` operator before a variable.  
- **Pointers**  
  - are variables that store an address.  
  - are specific to what type of address they can store.  
- The `*` operator can be used to:  
  - assign a pointer the type of the value its address holds,  
  - dereference a pointer and assign a new value.

### Instructions  
If you want to practice more with pointers and addresses:

1. Create a function that changes a **boolean** value from a different scope.  
2. Create a function that changes a **float** value from a different scope.  
3. Find the **zero value** of a pointer that is initialized but hasnâ€™t been assigned a value.
